            <h3>Eric:</h3>
            <p class = "ericanddyl"> Eric is someone who is very hard working and is also very fun to be around <br>
            I find Eric a nice guy and he is pretty funny too and he has that fresh cut :)</p>

            <h3>Dylan:</h3>
            <p class = "ericanddyl"> Dylan is kinda lazy and doesn't get his worked turned in on time. <br>
            I like to think of myself as a pretty nice guy and someone that is caring but I am quite the slacker. :)</p>
